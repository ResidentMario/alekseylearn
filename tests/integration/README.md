# integration

This folder contains the integration tests for the `fahr` library. These integration tests run
actual (simple) jobs on the job clients, and thus require that you have your local environment
configured for using them. Authorization credentials are provided to the jobs using environment
variables&mdash;see the scripts for more details.

These tests can be considered passed if the jobs complete successfully.
